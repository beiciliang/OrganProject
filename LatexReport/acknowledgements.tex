%Acknowledgement

Firstly I would like to thank Claire Singer, Janet Gilbert, Les Mommsen and Andy Gardner at the Union Chapel for their enthusiasm and warm help for granting me get access to the Henry Willis pipe organ, recording the audio, filming the hydraulics and providing me with so many archives for the app. Also thank James Richardson-Jones at the Duplex Pipe Organ and Blower Company Ltd. for his professional explanation of the hydraulic engines. 

From Queen Mary I would like to thank Gyorgy Fazekas for his invaluable support over the last five months, without him this project would not have been possible. Mark Sandler has been a constant support for his guidance and suggestions. I would also like to thank Jingwen Bai for teaching me so much in programming and photography.

Finally I would like to thank all those who are being so encouraging and supportive of this research.
